            <h3>NEW: Catalyst Cohort</h3>
            <p>We are introducing a cohort program that extends the vision of our Catalyst learn-a-thon. A select group of students will have the opportunity to join the Catalyst Cohort. Those who join the cohort will have a two-month immersive introductory STEM experience in web development before our learn-a-thon event! In addition to the extended exploration into web development, students will have the opportunity to engage in extracurricular activities, like field trips, office visits, and campus tours, for insight into professional and academic possibilities.
                 Cohort members will also have access to and work with HexLabs mentors to complete a unique personal project!</p>
