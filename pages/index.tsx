              We are introducing a cohort program that extends the vision 
              <br/>
              of our Catalyst learn-a-thon.

              <br />
              <br />
              Those who join the cohort will have a two-month immersive 
              <br />
              introductory STEM experience in web development before our learn-a-thon event!
              <br />
              <br />
              In addition to the extended exploration into web development, students will have the opportunity to engage in extracurricular activities,
              like field trips, office visits, and campus tours, for insight into professional and academic possibilities.
              Cohort members will also have access to and work with HexLabs mentors to complete a unique personal project!
              <br/><br/>
              <p>You can apply for the cohort when completing registration!</p>

                <h2>AI/ML</h2>
                <p>
                Do you ever wonder how things like Netflix recommendations and Spotify playlists are made?  Are you a technical person and like 
                learning about what goes on in the background? If so, you should consider the ML track!
                In this track, you will learn how concepts like Data Science and AI come together to create Machine Learning based products!  
                Things like data integration, learning models, and information recognition will become much less foreign to you after going through this track.

                <h2>Web Scraping</h2>
                <p>
                In this track, we'll teach you how to take in data from the web to use for analysis or code through Python. We will mainly be webscraping 
                websites- looking at the websites that you use everyday and give you a look behind the curtain into their web code and their data. At the 
                end of the day, every student will have the chance to choose their own topic and web data to investigate as a personal project. Make sure 
                to join this track if you want to expand your coding knowledge and are interested in the behind the scenes of the internet!

                <h2>Intro to Chemical Engineering</h2>
                <p>
                  This track aims to give students a brief overview about organic chemistry, chemical synthesis, and chemical engineering. We will introduce 
                  the basic concepts of organic chemistry, polymer science, and chemical engineering. In the end, students are able to work in groups to make 
                  chemical bonds, molecules, and polymer structures using the molecule kit provided by us. This workshop is for students who are interested in 
                  chemistry, chemical engineering, and biotechnology.

                <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
                <p>
                  If you're interested in technology and design, 
                  then UI/UX is the perfect combination! 
                  UI/UX is all about creating easy to use and visually appealing designs for websites and apps. 
                  It's a skill that is in high demand, as companies are focused 
                  on creating products that offer a great user experience. 
                  This track will teach you basic UI/UX principles, 
                  industry tools like Figma, and other skills that will help you 
                  succeed in a career in technology design.
