          <h3>About Your Trip</h3>
          <p>
            HexLabs presents Catalyst, a day of STEM-related activities directed toward high school
            students all throughout Georgia! We hope to see you on <b>Saturday, April 9th</b> at
            Georgia Tech! This will be an opportunity for participants to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Learn about the world of STEM and Computer Science as a career path</li>
            <li>Gain insight into impactful, widely-known technology companies</li>
            <li>Receive mentorship from college students and other industry professionals</li>

            <h3>During the Day</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout the day, students will have the opportunity to follow one of four
              tracks:Web Development, Product Development & Entrepreneurship, Data Science & AI, or
              Cybersecurity. Each track consists of interactive workshops and curriculum that
              encourages students to think critically and creatively. Additionally, there will be
              opportunities for students to engage and connect with various industry professionals
              and college students. We want to show high school students the value of computer
              science, which is why we are providing all of the resources {`you'll`} need to get
              started!
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>NEW: Catalyst Cohort</h3>
          <p>
            We are introducing a cohort program that extends the vision of our Catalyst
            learn-a-thon. A select group of students will have the opportunity to join the Catalyst
            Cohort. Those who join the cohort will have a two-month immersive introductory STEM
            experience in web development before our learn-a-thon event! In addition to the extended
            exploration into web development, students will have the opportunity to engage in
            extracurricular activities, like field trips, office visits, and campus tours, for
            insight into professional and academic possibilities. Cohort members will also have
            access to and work with HexLabs mentors to complete a unique personal project!
          </p>
          <h3>Our goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To foster connections between students with like-minded interest in computer science{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              To create a community beyond students’ high schools for discussion, interaction, and
              innovation
            </li>
            <li>
              To encourage the long-term development of students’ ability to create impactful
              projects
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can apply for the cohort when completing registration!</p>
